# Tic Tac Toe (TS/React)
## Description
This is the coding exercise. I completed this in 1 hr blocks across the last few days.
I wanted to complete the game's functionality and focused most of the time on that. I styled the app very minimally.

The task: React & Typescript - Tic Tac Toe. 

The objective is to build a 2 player Tic-Tac-Toe game with React and Typescript
- Assume that both players are playing on the same computer (the players alternate and they're using the same mouse/touchpad)
- The Tic-Tac-Toe board is not 3x3, but NxN
- The value of N is taken as an input from the user before the game round begins

It would be great if you could focus on using Typescript well & idiomatically in the app that you're building out to give us a sense of your familiarity with TS.

## TODOS
- css modules
- break out components/utils
